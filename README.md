# CS338-Project
This contains my project for CS 338 GUI class. It involves the Yummly app API to create a Java application for users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have.

This project's goals was to solve the problem when someone doesn’t know what to eat or make and needs to find recipes for ingredients that they currently have. My approach to solve this problem is to create an application that will use Yummly’s API and will allow users to enter in ingredients that they currently have and enter in criteria that Yummly uses to search for recipes. The application will compare the list of ingredients that the user has to the list of ingredients needed for each recipe from the search results. The application will then return a sorted list of recipes that encompasses the search criteria that user specifies, ranks them based on how many ingredients matchup, and displays what ingredients a user may be missing.

The project can be setup by importing the project folder and making sure that the project has gson-2.2.4.jar file in the lib folder of the project.
